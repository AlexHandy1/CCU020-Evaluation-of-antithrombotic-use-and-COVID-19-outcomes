[1] Codelists for individual drugs (e.g. apixaban) were selected from within their relevant drug category (e.g. DOACs). Other medications (e.g. anti-hypertensives) were selected based on high-level BNF chapter as outlined in protocol.   


[2] Codelist for uncontrolled hypertension refers to raw values of systolic blood pressure which was used to estimate individuals passing threshold of >160 mmHg systolic. Labile INR excluded from HAS-BLED due to lack of data availability.
